I write handy scripts and fun bits of code sometimes. I'll put them
here so I don't lose track of them. And, who knows? Maybe someone will
find one of them useful or interesting.

The fact that EVERYTHING needs a copyright notice and license is dumb,
but check out LICENSE.txt. It's the ISC license. Basically, do
whatever you want with this stuff.

For more information, see the code. The comments go into more detail.

  Summaries:

 to-30fps.sh: convert video files en masse to 30 fps .avi files via
mencoder.

 control-mplayer.sh: A proof-of-concept demo for controlling programs
(in this case, mplayer) with Unix pipes.
